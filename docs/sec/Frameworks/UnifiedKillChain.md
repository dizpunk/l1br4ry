# The Unified Kill Chain
The Unified Kill Chain aims to complement with other cybersecurity kill chain frameworks such as Lockheed Martin’s and MITRE’s ATT&CK.

The UKC identifies __18 phases__ to an attack, divided in 3 groups (__In__, __Through__ and __Out__): everything from reconnaissance to data exfiltration and understanding an attacker's motive. Some large benefits of the UKC over traditional cybersecurity kill chain frameworks are the facts that it is extremely up-to-date and detailed.
