# NIST Cybersecurity Framework
The __NIST Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF)__ is a set of guidelines, best practices, and standards developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to help organizations manage and improve their cybersecurity risk management processes. It was created in response to increasing cybersecurity threats and the need for a common language and approach to address cybersecurity challenges across different sectors and industries.

The NIST CSF is designed to be adaptable and applicable to organizations of all sizes and industries, helping them to assess and manage cybersecurity risks in a structured and comprehensive manner. It provides a framework that assists organizations in identifying, protecting, detecting, responding to, and recovering from cybersecurity incidents.

The framework is structured around three core components:

1. **Framework Core:** This component consists of five functions that represent the key aspects of managing cybersecurity risk. These functions are:
      - Identify: Understand and manage cybersecurity risks to systems, assets, data, and capabilities.
      - Protect: Implement safeguards to protect against cyber threats.
      - Detect: Develop and implement activities to identify cybersecurity events.
      - Respond: Develop and implement plans to take action against detected cybersecurity incidents.
      - Recover: Develop and implement plans for recovery and restoration after a cybersecurity incident.

2. **Framework Implementation Tiers:** These tiers describe the maturity of an organization's cybersecurity program and its ability to manage and reduce cybersecurity risk. The tiers range from "Partial" (Tier 1) to "Adaptive" (Tier 4), with each tier indicating a higher level of integration and sophistication in the organization's cybersecurity practices.

3. **Framework Profiles:** Profiles allow organizations to tailor the NIST CSF to their specific needs, priorities, and risk tolerance. A profile aligns an organization's cybersecurity activities with its business requirements, helping to establish a roadmap for cybersecurity improvement.

The NIST CSF is a flexible and dynamic framework that organizations can use to improve their cybersecurity posture over time. It's important to note that the framework doesn't provide a one-size-fits-all solution but rather a structured approach to help organizations build and customize their cybersecurity strategies based on their unique risk landscape.

Organizations can use the NIST CSF to:

- Identify and prioritize their cybersecurity risks.
- Develop and implement a cybersecurity strategy.
- Enhance communication about cybersecurity within the organization.
- Measure and monitor progress in managing cybersecurity risks.
- Establish a common language and understanding of cybersecurity concepts.
